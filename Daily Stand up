	1. What you did since last time? --> 
      - I set up the Trello page with Casey 
      - Created boards and made everyone an Admin 
      - 6/1 Assumed the role as Scrum Master and figured out most team mates schedule using an excel spread sheet I posted on slack.
      - 6/1
      
	2. What you will do for next time or what will you actually accomplish?
      - Not sure.  Have to consult with team about tasks.
      - Play Zork
      - Read 5 team disfunction
      - Get on discord
      - Set up python --> Luke told us to use VS Code, already downloaded.
      - Spike tickets?
      - Review Python?
      - 6/1 Email excell spread sheet to everyone.
      
	3. Blockers?
      - Some issues with git hub logon with other team mates.  Try to trouble shoot with them.
      - Request to join page issue through email or because some settings or a numeber was fat fingered somehow.
      - 6/1 I don't have Derek, Dan, Greg, Ed schedule
      - 6/1 not understanding some concepts: telescopic, static factory methods, Spike tickets
      - 6/1 There is a lot of heavy app usage that is hard to keep up with. (I like it but it's a little much).  Is there a more 
            streamlined way with less components to use?
      - 6/1
