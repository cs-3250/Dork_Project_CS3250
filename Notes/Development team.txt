The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable 
Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint. A “Done” increment is required at the Sprint 
Review. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment. 

Development Teams are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and manage their own 
work. The resulting synergy optimizes the Development Team’s overall efficiency and effectiveness. 

Development Teams have the following characteristics: 
• They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to 
turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;
 • Development Teams are cross-functional, with all the skills as a team necessary to create a 
product Increment; 
• Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members, regardless of the work being performed by 
the person; 
• Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team, regardless of domains that need to be 
addressed like testing, architecture, operations, or business analysis; and, 
• Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability 
belongs to the Development Team as a whole. 

Development Team Size Optimal Development Team size is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to 
complete significant work within a Sprint. Fewer than three Development Team members decrease interaction 
and results in smaller productivity gains. Smaller Development Teams may encounter skill constraints during 
the Sprint, causing the Development Team to be unable to deliver a potentially releasable Increment. 
Having more than nine members requires too much coordination. Large Development Teams generate too much 
complexity for an empirical process to be useful. The Product Owner and Scrum Master roles are not included 
in this count unless they are also executing the work of the Sprint Backlog.
