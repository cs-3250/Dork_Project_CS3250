The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a “Done”, useable, and potentially 
releasable product Increment is created. Sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort.
A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint. 

Sprints contain and consist of the Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, the development work, the Sprint Review, 
and the Sprint Retrospective. 

During the Sprint: 
  • No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal; 
  • Quality goals do not decrease; and, 
  • Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned. 

Each Sprint may be considered a project with no more than a one-month horizon. Like projects, Sprints are used to 
accomplish something. Each Sprint has a goal of what is to be built, a design and flexible plan that will guide 
building it, the work, and the resultant product increment. 

Sprints are limited to one calendar month. When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the definition of what is being built may change, 
complexity may rise, and risk may increase. Sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress 
toward a Sprint Goal at least every calendar month. Sprints also limit risk to one calendar month of cost. 

Cancelling a Sprint 
A Sprint can be cancelled before the Sprint time-box is over. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint, 
although he or she may do so under influence from the stakeholders, the Development Team, or the Scrum Master. 

A Sprint would be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. This might occur if the company changes direction or 
if market or technology conditions change. In general, a Sprint should be cancelled if it no longer makes sense given 
the circumstances. But, due to the short duration of Sprints, cancellation rarely makes sense. 

When a Sprint is cancelled, any completed and “Done” Product Backlog items are reviewed. If part of the work is potentially 
releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it. All incomplete Product Backlog Items are re-estimated and put back on 
the Product Backlog. The work done on them depreciates quickly and must be frequently re-estimated. 

Sprint cancellations consume resources, since everyone regroups in another Sprint Planning to start another Sprint. Sprint 
cancellations are often traumatic to the Scrum Team, and are very uncommon. Sprint Planning 

Sprint Planning. 
The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning.  This plan is created by the collaborative work 
of the entire Scrum Team. 

Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually 
shorter. The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose. The Scrum Master 
teaches the Scrum Team to keep it within the time-box. 

Sprint Planning answers the following: 
  • What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint? 
  • How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved? 

Topic One: What can be done this Sprint? 
The Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the Sprint. The Product Owner 
discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the Product Backlog items that, if completed in the Sprint,
would achieve the Sprint Goal. The entire Scrum Team collaborates on understanding the work of the Sprint. 

The input to this meeting is the Product Backlog, the latest product Increment, projected capacity of the Development 
Team during the Sprint, and past performance of the Development Team. The number of items selected from the Product 
Backlog for the Sprint is solely up to the Development Team. Only the Development Team can assess what it can accomplish 
over the upcoming Sprint. 

During Sprint Planning the Scrum Team also crafts a Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal is an objective that will be met within 
the Sprint through the implementation of the Product Backlog, and it provides guidance to the Development Team on why it 
is building the Increment. 

Topic Two: How will the chosen work get done? 
Having set the Sprint Goal and selected the Product Backlog items for the Sprint, the Development Team decides how it will 
build this functionality into a “Done” product Increment during the Sprint. The Product Backlog items selected for this 
Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called the Sprint Backlog. 

The Development Team usually starts by designing the system and the work needed to convert the Product Backlog into a working 
product Increment. Work may be of varying size, or estimated effort. However, enough work is planned during Sprint Planning 
for the Development Team to forecast what it believes it can do in the upcoming Sprint. Work planned for the first days of 
the Sprint by the Development Team is decomposed by the end of this meeting, often to units of one day or less. The Development 
Team self-organizes to undertake the work in the Sprint Backlog, both during Sprint Planning and as needed throughout the Sprint. 

The Product Owner can help to clarify the selected Product Backlog items and make trade-offs. If the Development Team determines 
it has too much or too little work, it may renegotiate the selected Product Backlog items with the Product Owner. The Development 
Team may also invite other people to attend to provide technical or domain advice.

By the end of the Sprint Planning, the Development Team should be able to explain to the Product Owner and Scrum Master how it 
intends to work as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment. 

Sprint Goal 
The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog. It provides 
guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment. It is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. 
The Sprint Goal gives the Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint. 
The selected Product Backlog items deliver one coherent function, which can be the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal can be 
any other coherence that causes the Development Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives. 

As the Development Team works, it keeps the Sprint Goal in mind. In order to satisfy the Sprint Goal, it implements 
functionality and technology. If the work turns out to be different than the Development Team expected, they collaborate 
with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.
