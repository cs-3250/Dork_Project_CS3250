The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements 
for any changes to be made to the product. The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, 
and ordering. 

A Product Backlog is never complete. The earliest development of it lays out the initially known and best-understood requirements. The 
Product Backlog evolves as the product and the environment in which it will be used evolves. The Product Backlog is dynamic; it constantly
changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate, competitive, and useful. If a product exists, its Product Backlog also 
exists. 

The Product Backlog lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to be made to the
product in future releases. Product Backlog items have the attributes of a description, order, estimate, and value. Product Backlog items 
often include test descriptions that will prove its completeness when “Done.” 

As a product is used and gains value, and the marketplace provides feedback, the Product Backlog becomes a larger and more exhaustive
list. Requirements never stop changing, so a Product Backlog is a living artifact. Changes in business requirements, market conditions, 
or technology may cause changes in the Product Backlog. 

Multiple Scrum Teams often work together on the same product. One Product Backlog is used to describe the upcoming work on the product.
A Product Backlog attribute that groups items may then be employed. 

Product Backlog refinement is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. This is an ongoing process 
in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog items. During Product Backlog
refinement, items are reviewed and revised. The Scrum Team decides how and when refinement is done. Refinement usually consumes no 
more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team. However, Product Backlog items can be updated at any time by the Product Owner 
or at the Product Owner’s discretion. 

Higher ordered Product Backlog items are usually clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones. More precise estimates are made 
based on the greater clarity and increased detail; the lower the order, the less detail. Product Backlog items that will occupy the 
Development Team for the upcoming Sprint are refined so that any one item can reasonably be “Done” within the Sprint time-box. Product 
Backlog items that can be “Done” by the Development Team within one Sprint are deemed “Ready” for selection in a Sprint Planning. 
Product Backlog items usually acquire this degree of transparency through the above described refining activities. 

The Development Team is responsible for all estimates. The Product Owner may influence the Development Team by helping it understand 
and select trade-offs, but the people who will perform the work make the final estimate.

Monitoring Progress Toward Goals 
At any point in time, the total work remaining to reach a goal can be summed. The Product Owner tracks this total work remaining at 
least every Sprint Review. The Product Owner compares this amount with work remaining at previous Sprint Reviews to assess progress 
toward completing projected work by the desired time for the goal. This information is made transparent to all stakeholders. 

Various projective practices upon trending have been used to forecast progress, like burndowns, burn-ups, or cumulative flows. These 
have proven useful. However, these do not replace the importance of empiricism. In complex environments, what will happen is unknown. 
Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision-making.
